# Web-Accessibility-Metrics-Dashboard

The primary goal of this project is to find how well educational institutions incorporate accessibility metrics in their websites. It has become important for universities to develop websites which are visually appealing as well as attract the best talent. However, some students landing on the university's website may be visually challenged. If accessibility metrics have not been taken care of by the university, the student may perceive the website (and the university) as not good enough for him or her. It has also been observed that many people do not realize they are color blind!

With a dataset of top 300 universities of USA, we analyzed landing pages of their websites using the tool Google Lighthouse. Majority of the institutions have taken care of most accessibility metrics.
